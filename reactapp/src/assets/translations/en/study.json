We have developed (at least) one educational game for each of the three solution methods - equalization, substitution and elimination- for systems of linear equations, which we would like to test together with you. Below you will find (at least) one section with various tasks and a tutorial or game instructions for each method. You have either received additional instructions from us or we will guide you through the tasks. In both cases, please follow the instructions carefully. Have fun!",
